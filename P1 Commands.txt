(1). CPU
=========
lscpu : The lscpu command provides detailed information about the CPU architecture and characteristics. 
cat /proc/cpuinfo : file contains information about the CPU and its features.
top & htop : The top and htop commands are system monitoring tools that provide real-time information about processes and system resources.
nproc : The nproc command displays the number of processing units available. 



(2). Memory
============
free : Total amount of free and used physical memory.
       Total amount of swap memory in the system.
       Buffers and caches used by the kernel.
       
free -m : for information and usage in MB.
free -g : for information and usage in GB.
free -t : This will simply total the amount of memory in columns.

vmstat : reports virtual memory statistics.

egrep --color 'Mem|Cache|Swap' /proc/meminfo : This will produce an easy to read listing of all entries that contain Mem, Cache, and Swap â€¦ with a splash of color.


(3). Disk
==========
df : shows available and used disk space on the Linux system.
df -h : shows disk space in human-readable format.
df -a : shows the file system's complete disk usage even if the Available field is 0.
df -T : shows the disk usage along with each block's filesystem type (e.g., xfs, ext2, ext3, btrfs, etc.).
du : shows the disk usage of files, folders, etc. in the default kilobyte size.
du -h :  shows disk usage in human-readable format for all directories and subdirectories.
du -a : shows disk usage for all files.
du -s : provides total disk space used by a particular file or directory.
sudo fdisk -l : shows disk size along with disk partitioning information.


(4). Network status
===================
ip a : Displays all network interfaces and IP addresses.
ifconfig : configure a network interface (-a, -s, -v).
ip r : Show the current routing table.
sudo ufw status : check firewall status. 



(5). Pending software updates
==============================
apt list --upgradable




Used Commands in the script :-
===============================


(0). in general :-
DIR="/home/hamdi-emad/Desktop/System_Reports" : Save the parent directory path in a variable.
REP="$DIR/System_Report_$(date +%d":"%m":"%Y___%H":"%M":"%S).txt" : Save the report file name and initialization date with the (day:month:year___hour:minute:second).
if [[ -d $DIR ]] : this condition checks whether the directory exist or not.
rm -rf $DIR/* : Delete the total contents of the directory.
mkdir -p "$DIR" : make a new directory with -p to indicate it as a parent directory.
touch $REP : to make a new report file in the directory.
printf and echo : to print the text in the file.



(1). The CPU :-
top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print "CPU Load: " $2+$4 "%"}' >> "$REP" :
top -bn1 : to run the command in batch mode and only once, which can display the information without the interface.
grep "Cpu(s)" : to search in the output for this word and display it without the other results.
awk '{print "CPU Load: " $2+$4 "%"}' : used to add the (us) and (sy) resulted from the previous command ($2 refers to "us" and $4 to "sy").Together, it represent the total CPU load.



(2). Memory :-
free -h :- gives the memory information in GB in human readable format.
egrep --color 'Mem|Cache|Swap' /proc/meminfo >> "$REP" :- egrep is similar to grep, but it supports an a method to search a pattern in regular expressions.
--color: Highlights the matched patterns in the output which are the words "Mem", "Cache" and "Swap".
/proc/meminfo: A saved file in Linux that contains detailed information about the system's memory usage. 



(3). Disk :-
df -h : shows disk space in human-readable format.



(4). Network :-
ip -brief address :- as it is clear and obvious, this command is used to get the network interfaces and the IP address.



(5). Pending software updates :-
UPD=$(apt list --upgradable 2>/dev/null | grep -v Listing) :-
apt list --upgradable : viewing the pending updates of the newer version packages in the system.
2>/dev/null : to dismiss the error messages.
grep -v Listing :- to search in the output of the word Listing.
UPD=$() : to put the output of the command in a variable named UPD.

and finally, to be able to send the report via user email:-
msmtp usermail@example.com < file.txt : to send the text file to the user email

for make this script automated, we entered crontab -e command and put this line :-
*/1 * * * * /home/hamdi-emad/Desktop/P1.sh : this line makes the script executed automatically every minute.

crontab  refers to cron table which is a time-based scheduler to automate the scripts.
* * * * * : represents the minute, hour, day of the month, month and day of the week.
if you want to automate the script to run every day in 5 AM, just make the first * to be 0 and the second one to be 5.
if you want to make it every period of time, make it like this */number.
