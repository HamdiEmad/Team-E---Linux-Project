Bash scripting (System Health Check Up &amp;&amp; Automated Backup and Recovery Tool)


The first bash script generates a system report containing details about CPU usage, memory status, disk space, network information, and pending software updates. The script is designed to run automatically every minute and stores each report in a designated directory.

The second onr allows the user to create compressed backups of specified directories, store them in a chosen destination, and optionally upload them to Google Drive using rclone. It also includes an automatic cleanup mechanism to delete backups older than 7 days.
